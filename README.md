# robot-framework-facade
Wrapper over basic Robot Framework keywords.
Helpful to decouple the project from the Automated Tool itself to isolate
the TAF business logic from the Automation Tool in the case a better tool
appears on the market in the future and the company/project has a desire to switch to the new tool.
